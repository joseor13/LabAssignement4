                <h1>SPEED & PERFORMANCE</h1>
                <p>Build features quickly with simple, declarative templates. Extend the template language with your
                    own
                    components and use a wide array of existing components. Get immediate Angular-specific help and
                    feedback with nearly every IDE and editor. All this comes together so you can focus on building
                    amazing apps rather than trying to make the code work. When building forms in Angular, it's
                    important to understand how the framework handles data flowing from the user or from
                    programmatic changes. Reactive and template-driven forms follow two different strategies when
                    handling form input. The data flow examples below begin with the favorite color input field
                    example from above, and then show how changes to favorite color are handled in reactive forms
                    compared to template-driven forms.</p>

                <h1>INCREDIBLE TOOLING</h1>
                <p>Achieve the maximum speed possible on the Web Platform today, and take it further, via Web
                    Workers
                    and server-side rendering. Angular puts you in control over scalability. Meet huge data
                    requirements by building data models on
                    RxJS, Immutable.js or another push-model. As described above, in reactive forms each form
                    element in the view is directly linked to a form model (FormControl instance). Updates from the
                    view to the model and from the model to the view are synchronous and aren't dependent on the UI
                    rendered. The diagrams below use the same favorite color example to demonstrate how data flows
                    when an input field's value is changed from the view and then from the model</p>

                <p>Installing the Angular service worker is as simple as including an NgModule. In addition to
                    registering the Angular service worker with the browser, this also makes a few services available
                    for injection which interact with the service worker and can be used to control it. For example, an
                    application can ask to be notified when a new update becomes available, or an application can ask
                    the service worker to check the server for available updates. To support these behaviors, the
                    Angular service worker loads a manifest file from the server. The manifest describes the resources
                    to cache and includes hashes of every file's contents. When an update to the application is
                    deployed, the contents of the manifest change, informing the service worker that a new version of
                    the application should be downloaded and cached. This manifest is generated from a CLI-generated
                    configuration file called ngsw-config.json.</p>
